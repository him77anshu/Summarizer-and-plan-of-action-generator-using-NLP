Bharat Mata Ki Jai is a festival to remember grit, resolve, and patriotic virtues. As an independent Bharat is reaching new milestones after 75 years of its journey, let us not leave any stone unturned. I have envisioned that by 2047, when the dream of a Viksit Bharat wil be realized. I will never shy away from hard work. I never back down in courage; I never fear facing challenges. Before independence, 40 crore countrymen showed immense spirit and capability. If our ancestors, whose blood flows in our veins, could achieve this, then today we are a country of 140 crore people. If 40 crore people could break the shackles of slavery, then 140 crore citizens can also build a prosperous Bharat. As we celebrate 75 years of the Indian Constitution, it is crucial for citizens to focus on the duties enshrined in the Constitution. It is our collective responsibility to realize the vision of the framers of our Constitution. I can see clearly that the blood of our ancestors is in the veins of the 140 crore people. We have extended paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks for working women. This motivates us to make compassionate decisions for the females of our country. We were pioneers in banning single-use plastics and have significantly advanced our renewable energy efforts. We want to prepare future-ready skilled resources in India.
